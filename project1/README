Considering how simple this program is, it was hard to write this in racket without making it
look like Dr. Clement's program. In this vain, I rewrote the program to be recursive instead
of iterative, and made use of the rs-append function (instead of rs-append*), which takes the
results of the recursive call as its second argument.
